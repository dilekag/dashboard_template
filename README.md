# Dashboard Template for Cameron County, TX COVID-19 Dashboard

This is a dashboard template based on a lung cancer dashboard I made with Dr. Bauer for a CPRIT-funded summer program (see repo titled dilekag/CPRIT).

The purpose of this dashboard template is to provide a template to create a dashboard that visualizes COVID-19 in Cameron County, Texas & how it relates to various socioeconomic factors.
